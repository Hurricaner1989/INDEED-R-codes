# INDEED R codes

These R codes implement INDEED algorithm from Zuo *et*. *al*.'s Methods paper: **INDEED: Integrated differential expression and differential network analysis of omic data for biomarker discovery** (PMID: 27592383). It contains one demo (i.e., **demo.R** and files in Data folder) and one **function.R**. 

## Update

### 03/02/17

I submit version 1.0 which contains one demo (i.e., **demo.R** and files in Data folder) and one **function.R**. 

* **demo.R** implements the proposed INDEED algorithm in Methods paper using metabolomic data.
* **function.R** implements three helper functions that are used in **demo.R**.
